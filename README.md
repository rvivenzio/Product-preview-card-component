### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned
My major learning was the properties of Flexbox. Below, a snippet of CSS code where I used this property.
 
```css
body {
    font-family: 'Outfit', sans-serif;
    background-color: var(--light-gray);
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    min-height: 100vh;
}
```

### Continued development
I would like to develop myself further in using properties like Flexbox and Grid, as well as improving my logic skills.

### Useful resources
- [A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This guide helped me understand better the Flexbox properties.
